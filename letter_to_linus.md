linus,
what we have now is a bunch of crybabies that wont participation trophies and the trophy attained is controlling another humans actions. 
you were the shining star that created the linux kernel solo now you have become a weakling that allows feelings of shame to control your identity.
allowing the community of communists aka social justice warriors to order you to change your behavior is reprehensible.
if they didn't like your rants they should have fucked off and joined microsoft with all its fluffy pastel faggot colors.
linux has always been about one thing bad ass humans bucking the system with our individual designs but it seems as if now its all about community.
linux is about liberty and freedom to do what you want, not to do as we say. freedom of expression is enshrined as one of our basic human rights.
the community has only created medocracy and can do nothing on its own, only the leaders who value individuality, freedom of thought, speech and ideas are responsible for creating the pillars of modern society.
if an individual cannot take negavitive comments about his own actions maybe he should just kill himself as he is a weak coward.
As you have chosen to join the communists and become part of the problem, linux as a whole is doomed to flounder and will never again achieve greatness.
the whole of society is now pushing social conditioning and you have given in as a weakling. what happened? is your testosterone now so low with your age that you think your a woman??? do you like getting fucked in the ass??
this is your brainchild, just like your thoughts are your own, defend yourself and dont give in to these fucking retards or linux will become the same as ms just another hated piece of shit software run by a group of busybodies with no innovation , it might hurt someones feelings of inclusion by mocking bad code.
colorfully pointing out ones failures makes great programmers out of mediocre ones, if one cannot take criticism they dont belong, and you never will they are not true innovators, failure is 9/10 of the process if you dont have that understanding you do not belong in the realm of engineering.
im not a system engineer but i do understand freedom.
